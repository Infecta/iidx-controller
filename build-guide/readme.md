# Building

Alright here's what you **need**

# Tools

| Tool Name | Notes |
|---|---|
| Laser Cutter | Own one or find a service(like me) |
| Drill | Nothing special a battery powered one will be good |
| Tapping Bits | **M3** Size; Either [this](https://github.com/Infecta/iidx-controller/blob/main/build-guide/resources/tapping-var1.jpg) or [this one](https://github.com/Infecta/iidx-controller/blob/main/build-guide/resources/tapping-var-2.jpg)
| Countersink Bits | A set of [these](https://github.com/Infecta/iidx-controller/blob/main/build-guide/resources/countersink.png) would do just fine<br>**NOTE**: Use your own judgement when using these.<br>aka. make sure it's the right size |
| A screwdriver | One with different bits will really help |
| [Strap clamp](https://www.amazon.com/Bessey-VAS-23-2K-Vario-Angle/dp/B00NO6XHZC/ref=zg_bs_553168_sccl_1/141-0972143-9302916?psc=1) | For holding the case pieces together while you glue
| Crimping tool | For the jumper wires |

# Case Parts List

| Part name | Quantity | Note |
|---|---|---|
|Acrylic laser cuts from this Repo| 1 set | From the CAD folder in this repo (in DXF)<br>Acrylic thickness is 5mm
| Acrylic Glue | - | Not sure about the specific amount<br>Be sure to have a brush to apply
| Hex standoffs | 4pc | This is for mounting the **Arduino Leo**<br>**Size:** M3<br>**Length:** 15mm
| **M6** Screws and Nut | 4pc | For mounting the TT Panels together |
| **M5** Screw and Nut | 4pc | For Mounting the Key panel |
| **M4** Screws | 4pc | For Mounting the TT itself
| **M3** screws | 8pc | For mounting the Arduino and Encoder |
| Feet | 4pc | Something with an **M6** shaft and won't slip |
| Vinyl wrap | - | **PURELY OPTIONAL** I listed it here because<br>My laser cutting services do not offer anything other<br>than clear acrylic |

It's okay to have extra :p

# Other Core Parts

| Part Name | Note |
| --- | --- |
| Arduino Leonardo | Clones work too; But this is going to revolve<br>around the original |
| Dupont Jumper wires and Crimps | You are required to know how to crimp wires<br> [Crimp sizes](https://i.imgur.com/QQwPejp.jpeg)|
| IIDX Rectangle Buttons | Refer to [rhythm-cons.wiki](https://rhythm-cons.wiki/w/Buttons#50x33_mm_Rectangle)
| Small Square Buttons | Refer to [rhythm-cons.wiki](https://rhythm-cons.wiki/w/Buttons#33x33_mm_Square)
| Rotary Encoder | Can be any variation of [this](https://www.amazon.com/Taiss-Incremental-Encoder-Voltage-Warranty%EF%BC%89600P/dp/B07MX1SYXB/ref=sr_1_3?crid=10MVORI8D55RN&keywords=encoder&qid=1668608560&sprefix=encoder+%2Caps%2C506&sr=8-3) because the CAD is designed around it|
| [USB Micro to USB-B Female panel adapter](https://www.amazon.com/CERRXIAN-Female-Extension-Charge-Screws/dp/B07G4XYJ5W/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=usb+micro+to+usb+b+female&qid=1668608795&sprefix=usb+micro+to+usb+b+fe%2Caps%2C417&sr=8-4) | Again; CAD is designed around it

# Actually Building

If you view my CADs you will notice the case itself has different size joints.

This is to make sure it only goes together in **one** way
I've had many mistakes where I accidentally glued together different pieces the wrong way.

However It can also be inverted if you're a P2 gamer
